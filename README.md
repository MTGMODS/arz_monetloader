# 🧩 MonetLoader Builder for Arizona Mobile [![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MTGMODS/arz_monetloader?label=Download%20Latest%20APK&style=for-the-badge&color=success)](https://github.com/MTGMODS/arz_monetloader/releases/latest)

An **external automation tool** (patcher) that adds **Lua scripting support** to the **[Arizona Mobile](https://arzgame.online/)** client through the external **[MonetLoader](https://github.com/xefinity/MonetLoaderOSS)** library.

This repository contains a build pipeline that dynamically patches the game. It is responsible for:
- 📥 Downloading the official client and decompiling it locally
- 🧩 Automatically unpacking MonetLoader resource files
- 🗒️ Automatically installing default Lua scripts & libs
- 🔄 Checking if the launcher version is up to date
- 💰 Managing Unity Ads behavior *(to support the continued development of this tool)*

## 📥 Installation (For Players)

If you only want to play, you don't need to build the project yourself. 

Our automated CI/CD pipeline builds the latest version every time the game updates.

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/MTGMODS/arz_monetloader/releases/latest).
2. Download the latest `MonetLoader vX.X.X.apk`.
3. Install the APK on your Android device and grant the necessary permissions.
4. Use the `/mtg` command in-game to manage your scripts!

- 1️⃣ Adds **Lua scripting** support via **MonetLoader** (32-bit only)
- 2️⃣ Integrates **MTG Tools** module and **Unity Ads** SDK
- 3️⃣ Automatically analyzes the `libsamp.so` and generates memory offsets (`profile.json`) for game updates

### ⚙️ MonetLoader Integration
- Provides Lua-based scripting support & includes required resource files
- Installs default Lua scripts and required libraries automatically

### 🧰 MTG Tools
- Automatically extracts required Lua libraries and helper assets
- Manages bundled MTG modules and performs version checks

### 💰 Unity Ads

# 🚀 Build Process (Local Development)

If you want to compile the project yourself:

### 1️⃣ Requirements
- **Python 3.10+** (requires requests and python-dotenv modules)
- **Java 8+** (for dynamic compilation and apktool)
- **Keystore for signing the final APK** *(if not provided — unsigned apk will be saved)*
---
### 2️⃣ Build Steps

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MTGMODS/arz_monetloader.git
cd arz_monetloader
```
2. Install **Python** dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set **your keystore** credentials in the **.env** file located in the project root

```bash
KEY_ALIAS="alias"
KEY_PASS="key_password"
KEYSTORE_PASS="keystore_password" # optional if same as KEY_PASS
```

4. Run the build script in terminal:
```bash
python build_launcher.py
```
The script will automatically download the original APK, decompile it, inject the Smali code, compile your Java wrapper, automatic profile.json generation, build the project, and sign the final APK.

---

### ⚠️ Fallback for `profile.json` (If auto-generation fails or for custom libsamp.so)
The compat_profile.py script automatically calculates memory offsets for the official Arizona Mobile client. 

If the script throws an error during the offset search, you can update it manually:
- Open build_launcher.py and comment out or remove all the update_compat(...) lines.
- Manually update files/assets/monetloader/compat/profile.json for the current libsamp version.
- See tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6gdRxX3lSc
